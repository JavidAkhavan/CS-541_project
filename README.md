This paper aims to provide a classification solution for detection of anomalies from point cloud data. The authors first provided a brief summary of how they pre-processed the point cloud to make it network ready inputs, and later, they compared multiple ML based methods for classification of their data. They also suggested a new network design of Hybrid CNN networks with CAE which made the training and their accuracy much better than the other available methods. They are using Mendeley: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zyz6cznm5h/3
